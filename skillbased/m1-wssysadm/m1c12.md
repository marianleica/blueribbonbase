<p>Create a user in your domain environment: batman@<domain>.com and add the user to the Domain Administrators group. Add a Windows 10/11 client machine to your domain environment. Log in to the client machine with the batman user.</p>

In the client machine, create a PS script which checks all the servers in the domain, and using PowerShell Remoting in a one-to-many session install the Failover Clustering feature on all servers.

Put the *.ps1 script file on a share path \\<machine-name>\administrativeScripts\  and ensure only Domain Administrators have access to the path.

### background

<p>Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It allows you to create and manage users, groups, and computers within a domain environment.</p>

### resolution

To create a user in your domain environment, add the user to the Domain Administrators group, add a Windows 10/11 client machine to your domain environment, log in to the client machine with the new user, create a PowerShell script to install the Failover Clustering feature on all servers, and put the script on a share path with restricted access, follow these steps:

1. Create the user in Active Directory:

   1.1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers on the Domain Controller:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `dsa.msc`, and press `Enter`.

   1.2. Create a new user:
   - Right-click on the `Users` container or an appropriate organizational unit (OU) and select `New` > `User`.
   - Enter the following details:
     - First name: `Batman`
     - User logon name: `batman`
   - Click `Next` and set a password for the user.
   - Click `Next` and then `Finish` to create the user.

2. Add the user to the Domain Administrators group:

   2.1. In Active Directory Users and Computers, locate the `batman` user.
   - Right-click on the user and select `Add to a group`.
   - Type `Domain Admins` and click `OK`.

3. Add the Windows 10/11 client machine to the domain:

   3.1. On the Windows 10/11 client machine, open `Settings` > `System` > `About`.
   - Click on `Join a domain`.
   - Enter the domain name and click `Next`.
   - Enter the credentials of a domain administrator when prompted.
   - Restart the client machine to complete the process.

4. Log in to the client machine with the batman user:

   4.1. On the Windows 10/11 client machine, press `Ctrl + Alt + Delete` and click `Switch user`.
   - Click on `Other user` and enter the following credentials:
     - Username: `batman@<domain>.com`
     - Password: The password set during user creation
   - Press `Enter` to log in.

5. Create a PowerShell script to install the Failover Clustering feature on all servers:

   5.1. Open PowerShell ISE on the client machine:
   - Press `Win + S` to open the search bar.
   - Type `PowerShell ISE` and press `Enter`.

   5.2. Write and save the following PowerShell script:
   ```powershell
   # Define the list of server names
   $servers = Get-ADComputer -Filter {OperatingSystem -Like "*Windows Server*"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name

   # Create a one-to-many session
   $session = New-PSSession -ComputerName $servers

   # Install the Failover Clustering feature on all servers
   Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock {
       Install-WindowsFeature -Name Failover-Clustering -IncludeManagementTools
   }

   # Close the session
   Remove-PSSession -Session $session
   ```

6. Put the script on a share path with restricted access:

   6.1. Create a shared folder on the client machine:
   - Open File Explorer and create a folder named `administrativeScripts`.
   - Right-click on the folder and select `Properties`.
   - Go to the `Sharing` tab and click `Advanced Sharing`.
   - Check `Share this folder` and click `Permissions`.
   - Remove `Everyone` and add `Domain Admins` with `Full Control` permissions.
   - Click `OK` to apply the changes.

   6.2. Copy the PowerShell script to the shared folder:
   - Copy the script file to `\\<machine-name>\administrativeScripts\`.

You have now created a user in your domain environment, added the user to the Domain Administrators group, added a Windows 10/11 client machine to your domain environment, logged in to the client machine with the new user, created a PowerShell script to install the Failover Clustering feature on all servers, and put the script on a share path with restricted access.
