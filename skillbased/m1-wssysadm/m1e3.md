<p>Use CMD to find (a) your host machine’s IP address, (b) the IP address of “kurzgesagt.org".</p>

### background

<p>IP addresses of public websites are unique numerical labels assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. These addresses are essential for routing data across the internet, allowing devices to locate and communicate with each other.</p>

<p>Imagine you are a network administrator troubleshooting connectivity issues for users trying to access a specific website, such as "kurzgesagt.org". To diagnose the problem, you need to determine the IP address of the website to ensure that it is reachable from your network.</p>

By using the `nslookup` command in CMD, you can quickly find the IP address associated with the domain name.

<p>This command will display the IP address of "kurzgesagt.org", which you can then use to perform further network diagnostics, such as pinging the IP address to check for connectivity or tracing the route to identify any network bottlenecks.</p>
