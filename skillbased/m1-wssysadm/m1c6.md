<p>Create a nested virtualization scenario with Hyper-V (run a virtual machine inside which you run another virtual machine).</p>

### background

<p>Nested virtualization allows you to run a virtual machine inside another virtual machine. This is useful for testing and development purposes. Hyper-V supports nested virtualization on certain hardware configurations.</p>

### resolution

To create a nested virtualization scenario with Hyper-V, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your host machine supports nested virtualization:
   - Open PowerShell with administrative privileges by pressing `Win + X` and selecting `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.
   - Run the following command to check if your CPU supports nested virtualization:
     ```powershell
     Get-VMHost | fl *
     ```
   - Look for the `NestedVirtualizationSupported` property. It should be `True`.

2. Create the first-level virtual machine (VM1) using Hyper-V Manager or PowerShell:
   - Follow the steps in previous exercises to create a virtual machine named `VM1`.

3. Enable nested virtualization for VM1:
   - Open PowerShell with administrative privileges.
   - Run the following command to enable nested virtualization for VM1:
     ```powershell
     Set-VMProcessor -VMName VM1 -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
     ```

4. Start VM1 and install an operating system (e.g., Windows 10).

5. Inside VM1, install Hyper-V:
   - Open PowerShell inside VM1 with administrative privileges.
   - Run the following command to install Hyper-V:
     ```powershell
     Install-WindowsFeature -Name Hyper-V -IncludeManagementTools -Restart
     ```

6. After the restart, open Hyper-V Manager inside VM1 and create the second-level virtual machine (VM2):
   - Follow the steps in previous exercises to create a virtual machine named `VM2` inside VM1.

7. Start VM2 and install an operating system (e.g., Windows 10).

You now have a nested virtualization scenario with VM2 running inside VM1, which is running on your host machine.
