### resolution

To configure the File Server Role on one of your domain-joined VMs, create a file share `\\<server>\officework`, and limit access only to Domain Administrators, follow these steps:

1. Configure the File Server Role:

   1.1. Open Server Manager on the VM:
   - Click on `Manage` and select `Add Roles and Features`.
   - Follow the wizard to install the `File and Storage Services` role and the `File Server` role service.

2. Create the file share:

   2.1. Open Server Manager and go to `File and Storage Services` > `Shares`.
   - Click on `Tasks` and select `New Share`.
   - Follow the wizard to create a new SMB share with the following settings:
     - Share name: `officework`
     - Path: Select or create a folder for the share.

3. Configure permissions:

   3.1. In the `Permissions` step of the wizard, click on `Customize permissions`.
   - Remove any existing permissions and add the `Domain Admins` group with `Full Control` permissions.
   - Click `OK` to apply the permissions.

4. Verify the file share:

   4.1. Open File Explorer on a domain-joined client machine.
   - Type `\\<server>\officework` in the address bar and press `Enter`.
   - Verify that only Domain Administrators can access the share.

You have now configured the File Server Role, created a file share `\\<server>\officework`, and limited access only to Domain Administrators.
