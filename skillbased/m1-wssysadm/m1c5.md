<p>Document your way to finding the process ID (PID) for a Virtual Machine running with Hyper-V Virtualization.</p>

### background

<p>Hyper-V is a virtualization technology from Microsoft that allows you to create and manage virtual machines. Each virtual machine runs as a separate process on the host operating system, and each process has a unique process ID (PID).</p>

### resolution

To find the process ID (PID) for a Virtual Machine running with Hyper-V Virtualization, follow these steps:

1. Open Task Manager:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager.
   - Go to the `Details` tab.
   - Look for the `vmwp.exe` process, which corresponds to the Virtual Machine Worker Process.
   - Note the PID for the `vmwp.exe` process associated with your virtual machine.

2. Alternatively, you can use PowerShell to find the PID:
   - Open PowerShell with administrative privileges by pressing `Win + X` and selecting `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

3. Use the following command to list detailed information about all running virtual machines:
   ```powershell
   Get-VM | fl *
   ```
   This command retrieves detailed information about each running virtual machine, including the process ID (PID).

4. Review the output to find the PID for the specific virtual machine you are interested in.
