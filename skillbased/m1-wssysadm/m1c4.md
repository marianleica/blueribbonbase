### background

<p>CMD, or Command Prompt, is a command-line interpreter application available in most Windows operating systems. It allows users to execute various commands to perform tasks, such as managing files, running programs, and configuring system settings.</p>

### resolution

To create a file and extension that can be opened with CMD, which creates a file with specific content and copies it to the Desktop, follow these steps:

1. Open Notepad and create a batch file with the following content:
   ```batch
   @echo off
   mkdir C:\tmp
   echo Here I am > C:\tmp\mytext.txt
   copy C:\tmp\mytext.txt %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\
   ```
   Save the file with a `.bat` extension, for example, `createfile.bat`.

2. Open Command Prompt:
   - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `cmd` and press `Enter`.

3. Navigate to the location where you saved the batch file:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Path\To\BatchFile
   ```

4. Run the batch file by typing its name and pressing `Enter`:
   ```cmd
   createfile.bat
   ```
   This will execute the commands in the batch file, creating the file `C:\tmp\mytext.txt` with the specified content and copying it to the Desktop.
