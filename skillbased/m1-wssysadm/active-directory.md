### Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is used for managing and organizing network resources, such as users, computers, and groups, within a domain. Active Directory provides authentication, authorization, and directory services, making it an essential tool for IT administrators.

#### Features

Active Directory offers several features that enhance network management and security:

- **Centralized Management**: Provides a single interface for managing users, computers, groups, and other network resources.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Manages user authentication and access control, ensuring secure access to network resources.
- **Group Policy**: Allows administrators to define and enforce policies for users and computers across the domain.
- **Replication**: Ensures data consistency across multiple domain controllers through automatic replication.
- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale deployments with millions of objects in the directory.

#### Components

Active Directory consists of several key components:

- **Domain**: A logical grouping of network resources, such as users, computers, and groups, managed by a domain controller.
- **Domain Controller**: A server that hosts the Active Directory database and provides authentication and directory services.
- **Organizational Unit (OU)**: A container used to organize and manage objects within a domain.
- **Forest**: A collection of one or more domains that share a common schema and global catalog.
- **Global Catalog**: A distributed data repository that contains a searchable, partial representation of every object in the directory.
