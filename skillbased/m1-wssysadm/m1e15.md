<p>Use a Domain Controller (DC) and configure two other Windows Server nodes to form a Failover Cluster.</p>

### background

<p>Failover Clustering is a feature of Windows Server that provides high availability and scalability for applications and services. A failover cluster is a group of independent computers that work together to increase the availability of applications and services.</p>

### resolution

To configure a Domain Controller (DC) and set up two other Windows Server nodes to form a Failover Cluster, follow these steps:

1. Configure the Domain Controller (DC):

   1.1. Set up a Windows Server VM as a Domain Controller:
   - Follow the steps in previous exercises to install the `Active Directory Domain Services` role and promote the server to a domain controller.

2. Configure the two Windows Server nodes:

   2.1. Join the two Windows Server VMs to the domain:
   - Open Server Manager on each VM.
   - Click on `Local Server` and then on `Workgroup`.
   - In the `System Properties` window, click on `Change`.
   - Select `Domain` and enter the domain name.
   - Enter the credentials of a domain administrator when prompted.
   - Restart each VM to complete the process.

3. Install the Failover Clustering feature:

   3.1. Open Server Manager on each of the two Windows Server nodes:
   - Click on `Manage` and select `Add Roles and Features`.
   - Follow the wizard to install the `Failover Clustering` feature.

4. Validate the cluster configuration:

   4.1. Open the Failover Cluster Manager on one of the nodes:
   - Click on `Validate Configuration`.
   - Add the two Windows Server nodes to the validation wizard.
   - Run all tests to ensure the configuration is suitable for clustering.

5. Create the Failover Cluster:

   5.1. In the Failover Cluster Manager, click on `Create Cluster`:
   - Add the two Windows Server nodes to the cluster.
   - Follow the wizard to complete the cluster creation process.
   - Provide a cluster name and IP address.

6. Verify the cluster configuration:

   6.1. In the Failover Cluster Manager, ensure that the cluster is created successfully and both nodes are online.

You have now configured a Domain Controller and set up two other Windows Server nodes to form a Failover Cluster.
