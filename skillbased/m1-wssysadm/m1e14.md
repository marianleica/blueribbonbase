<p>Install the IIS role on one of your domain-joined servers. Add an external vSwitch and try to access the website via IP address from a different network.</p>

### background

<p>Internet Information Services (IIS) is a flexible, secure, and manageable Web server for hosting anything on the Web. Hyper-V allows you to create virtual switches to manage network connectivity for virtual machines.</p>

### resolution

To install the IIS role on one of your domain-joined servers, add an external vSwitch, and access the website via IP address from a different network, follow these steps:

1. Install the IIS role:

   1.1. Open Server Manager on the VM:
   - Click on `Manage` and select `Add Roles and Features`.
   - Follow the wizard to install the `Web Server (IIS)` role.

2. Add an external virtual switch:

   2.1. Open Hyper-V Manager on the host machine.
   - Click on `Virtual Switch Manager` in the right pane.
   - Select `New virtual network switch` and choose `External`.
   - Click `Create Virtual Switch`.
   - Name the switch (e.g., `ExternalSwitch`) and select the network adapter to bind to.
   - Click `OK` to create the switch.

3. Connect the VM to the external virtual switch:

   3.1. In Hyper-V Manager, right-click on the VM and select `Settings`.
   - Go to `Network Adapter` and select the newly created external switch (`ExternalSwitch`).
   - Click `OK` to apply the changes.

4. Configure the website:

   4.1. Open IIS Manager on the VM.
   - Expand the server node and select `Sites`.
   - Right-click on `Default Web Site` and select `Edit Bindings`.
   - Ensure that the site is bound to `All Unassigned` IP addresses on port `80`.

5. Access the website from a different network:

   5.1. Find the IP address of the VM:
   - Open Command Prompt on the VM and type `ipconfig`.
   - Note the IP address assigned to the network adapter connected to the external switch.

   5.2. From a different network, open a web browser and type the IP address of the VM in the address bar:
   - For example, `http://<IP_Address>`.
   - Verify that the default IIS welcome page is displayed.

You have now installed the IIS role on your domain-joined server, added an external vSwitch, and accessed the website via IP address from a different network.
