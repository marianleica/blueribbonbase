<p>On a Windows Server VM in Hyper-V configure Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) with the @bestofthebest.com domain. Add another Windows Server VM to the domain.</p>

### background

<p>Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. A server running ADDS is called a domain controller.</p>

### resolution

To configure ADDS on a Windows Server VM and add another Windows Server VM to the domain, follow these steps:

1. Configure ADDS on the first Windows Server VM (DC1):

   1.1. Open Server Manager and add the ADDS role:
   - Open Server Manager.
   - Click on `Manage` and select `Add Roles and Features`.
   - Follow the wizard to install the `Active Directory Domain Services` role.

   1.2. Promote the server to a domain controller:
   - After the ADDS role is installed, click on the notification flag in Server Manager and select `Promote this server to a domain controller`.
   - Select `Add a new forest` and enter `bestofthebest.com` as the root domain name.
   - Follow the wizard to complete the configuration and restart the server.

2. Add the second Windows Server VM (Server2) to the domain:

   2.1. Configure network settings:
   - Ensure that both VMs are connected to the same internal virtual switch.

   2.2. Join Server2 to the domain:
   - Open Server Manager on Server2.
   - Click on `Local Server` and then on `Workgroup`.
   - In the `System Properties` window, click on `Change`.
   - Select `Domain` and enter `bestofthebest.com`.
   - Enter the credentials of a domain administrator when prompted.
   - Restart Server2 to complete the process.

3. Verify the domain configuration:
   - Log in to Server2 using a domain account.
   - Open Command Prompt and type the following command to verify the domain membership:
     ```cmd
     systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"Domain"
     ```
   - Ensure that the output shows `bestofthebest.com` as the domain.

You have now configured ADDS on the first Windows Server VM and added the second Windows Server VM to the domain.
