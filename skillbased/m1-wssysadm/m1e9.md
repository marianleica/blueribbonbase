<p>Build a PowerShell script that asks the user input for a directory path and then adds it to the system’s environment variables.</p>

### background

<p>PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and the associated scripting language. Environment variables are used to store system-wide values that can be accessed by various applications and processes.</p>

### resolution

To create a PowerShell script that asks the user for a directory path and then adds it to the system’s environment variables, follow these steps:

1. Open PowerShell ISE:
   - Press `Win + S` to open the search bar.
   - Type `PowerShell ISE` and press `Enter`.

2. Write and run the following PowerShell script:
   ```powershell
   # Ask the user for a directory path
   $directoryPath = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the directory path to add to the system's environment variables"

   # Add the directory path to the system's PATH environment variable
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$directoryPath", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

   # Confirm the addition
   Write-Output "The directory path has been added to the system's environment variables."
   ```
   This script will prompt the user for a directory path, add it to the system's PATH environment variable, and confirm the addition.
